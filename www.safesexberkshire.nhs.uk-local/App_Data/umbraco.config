<p>Some people are worried about leaving their details even though we are extremely protective of your confidentiality. You will understand that for future visits and to link you to your tests we will need a constant identifier. For this reason we do always need a date of birth and your post code.</p>
<p>If your first language is not English and you need help during your visit to communicate we can arrange interpreters. You will need to ask a friend to call the clinic to arrange this. Alternatively you may have a friend who speaks English who is happy to come to the clinic with you and interpret for you.</p>
<p>Following registration you will be given a clinic number by the clinician. This clinic number is really important in all your communications with the clinic, it links you to your record. It is your unique number and you will need it to access any test results, it is used instead of your name to ensure your privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p>If you are not given this card for any reason please ask the clinician before leaving the clinic. You may not want to keep the card but do please keep a record of the number, perhaps by taking a photograph on your phone. Any test results will not be given out unless you have this unique number.</p>
<p>Once you are registered you will be asked to wait in the waiting room. Patients are encouraged to wait in the waiting room away from the reception desk to give patients at the desk privacy.</p>

It is your unique number and you will need it to access any test results, it is used instead of your name to ensure your privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p>If you are not given this card for any reason please ask the clinician before leaving the clinic. You may not want to keep the card but do please keep a record of the number, perhaps by taking a photograph on your phone. Any test results will not be given out unless you have this unique number.</p>
<p>Once you are registered you will be asked to wait in the waiting room. Patients are encouraged to wait in the waiting room away from the reception desk to give patients at the desk privacy.</p>

          <usefulInformationForPatients><![CDATA[<p>You will be called by a clinician from the waiting room by your first name. Please note that you will not necessarily be called in numerical order as there will often be different clinics running at the same time and some patients may have appointments for these clinics.</p>
<p>Waiting times vary enormously in the walk-in and wait clinics. On a quiet day if your needs are straightforward you may be in and out within 20 minutes but on a busy day or if your needs are more complex you may be in clinic for up to 2 hours.</p>
<p>We will always try and meet your needs as quickly as is possible. If you need to leave the waiting room please tell the receptionists. If you leave the clinic for long periods of time you may compromise your care and the clinician you need to see may become unavailable.</p>]]></usefulInformationForPatients>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the UK. It is a bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis and is particularly common in sexually active teenagers and young adults. Most people with chlamydia don't notice any symptoms and don't know they have it but can still pass it on to others through unprotected sex.</p>
<p>If you do develop symptoms, you may experience some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain when urinating,</li>
<li>Unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or rectum (back passage)</li>
<li>Pain in the tummy, bleeding during or after sex, and bleeding between periods (women)</li>
<li>Pain and swelling in the testicles (men)</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment for chlamydia is usually with antibiotic tablets, <span class="newWindow"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Chlamydia/Pages/Introduction.aspx" target="_blank">read more about chlamydia at NHS Choices</a></span>.</p>

<p>In men under the age of 35 years it is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the water pipe e.g. <a data-id="1325" href="/{localLink:1325}" title="Chlamydia">chlamydia</a> or <a data-id="1326" href="/{localLink:1326}" title="Gonorrhoea">gonorrhoea.</a></p>
<p>Prompt medical assessment is needed to make sure you don't have a twisted testicle (testicular torsion) as this can result in long term damage to the testicle if not dealt with quickly.</p>
<p>If you have epididymo-orchitis we recommend that you should have routine tests for all sexually transmitted infections including <a data-id="1325" href="/{localLink:1325}" title="Chlamydia">chlamydia</a>, <a data-id="1326" href="/{localLink:1326}" title="Gonorrhoea">gonorrhoea,</a> <a data-id="1329" href="/{localLink:1329}" title="Syphilis">syphilis</a> and <a data-id="1331" href="/{localLink:1331}" title="HIV">HIV</a>.</p>
<p><span>In men under the age of 35 years the most common cause is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea with local spread from the water pipe.</span><br /><span>In men over the age of 35 years the most common cause is a urine infection - with local spread of infection from the bladder.  This may also occur after surgical procedures such as cystoscopy or catheterisation.</span><br /><span>Occasionally it may also be due to a ‘gut' bacterial infection from insertive anal intercourse.</span><br /><span>Rarely epididymo-orchitis may be caused by other infections such as mumps or tuberculosis.</span></p>
<p>Epidiymo-orchitis is easily treated with antibiotics, painkillers and rest but the pain frequently takes weeks to months to totally settle.</p>]]></bodyText>

<p>It is passed by close contact and so is referred to as a sexually transmitted infection.<br />Genital herpes is a chronic (long-term) condition.</p>
<p>The virus remains in your body and can become active again. The average rate of recurrence is four to five times in the first two years after being infected. However, over time, it tends to become active less frequently and each outbreak becomes less severe.</p>
<p>There are often few or no initial symptoms, at least eight out of 10 people who carry the virus are unaware they have been infected because. However, certain triggers can activate the virus, causing an outbreak of genital herpes.</p>
<p>Treatment: There is no cure for HSV but medication is available to help prevent the HSV from multiplying.</p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Genital warts are the result of a viral skin infection caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). The HPV is not a single virus, but a family of more than 100 different strains of viruses. Different strains usually affect different parts of the body, including the hands or feet.</p>
<p>Although around 30 different types of HPV can affect the genital skin, most cases are caused by just two types (type 6 and type 11). The types of HPV that cause visible genital warts do not cause genital cancer, some other strains of HPV can cause cervical cancer.</p>
<p>Symptoms - visible warts (small fleshy growths, bumps or skin changes) that appear on or around the genital or anal area. They are usually painless and do not pose a serious threat to health, but they can be unpleasant to look at and cause psychological distress.</p>
<p>Treatment for genital warts depends on how many warts you have and where they are. Several treatments are available, such as liquids or creams and freezing the warts (cryotherapy).</p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Hepatitis is the term used to describe inflammation of the liver. It's usually the result of a viral infection or liver damage caused by drinking alcohol.  There are several different types of hepatitis, most of which are outlined below.  Some types will pass without any serious problems, while others can be long-lasting (chronic) and cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), loss of liver function and, in some cases, liver cancer.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hepatitis A</strong></span></h3>
<p>Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus.  It's usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the poo of an infected person and is most common in countries where sanitation is poor.  Hepatitis A usually passes within a few months, although it can occasionally be severe and even life-threatening.  There's no specific treatment for it, other than to relieve symptoms such as pain, nausea and itching.</p>
<p>Vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended if you are a man who has sex with other men.  This can be provided as part of you sexual health check-up. </p>
<p>If you are planning on travelling to an area where the virus is common, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Central and South America, the Far East and Eastern Europe then we would recommend contacting your GP and having this vaccination as part of you travel plans.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hepatitis B</strong></span></h3>
<p>Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus, which is spread in the blood of an infected person.  It's a common infection worldwide and is usually spread from infected pregnant women to their babies, or from child-to-child contact.  In rare cases, it can be spread through unprotected sex and injecting drugs.  Hepatitis B is uncommon in the UK and most cases affect people who became infected while growing up in part of the world where the infection is more common, such as Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Most adults infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months.  However, most people infected as children develop a long-term infection.  This is known as chronic hepatitis B and it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Antiviral medication can be used to treat it.</p>
<p>In the UK, vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as  people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, sex workers and people who pay for sex.  This can be provided as part of you sexual health check-up. </p>
<p>If you are planning on travelling to part of the world where the infection is more common then we would recommend contacting your GP and having this vaccination as part of you travel plans.</p>

<h3><strong>Hepatitis C</strong></h3>
<p>Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus and is the most common type of viral hepatitis in the UK.  It's usually spread through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.  In the UK, it's most commonly spread through sharing needles used to inject drugs.  Poor healthcare practices and unsafe medical injections are the main way it’s spread outside the UK. It is uncommon for hepatitis C to be passed through sex.  Hepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or only flu-like symptoms, so many people are unaware they're infected.</p>
<p>Around one in four people will fight off the infection and be free of the virus.  In the remaining cases, it will stay in the body for many years.  This is known as chronic hepatitis C and can cause cirrhosis and liver failure.</p>
<p>Chronic hepatitis C can be treated with very effective antiviral medications, but there's currently no vaccine available.</p>

<p>If you have been in contact with someone who has recently been diagnosed with hepatitis A or hepatitis B then let the clinic staff know as you may be offered these vaccinations to protect you.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the immune system, and weakens your ability to fight infections and disease. It is most commonly caught by having unprotected sex (sex without a condom) but can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment, and from an HIV positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding.</p>
<p>HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person, which includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood, and breast milk. It is a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long. If a person is on HIV treatment, the number of viruses in their system may be reduced to a level that is undetectable, making it very unlikely that they can pass on the infection.</p>
<p>Being diagnosed with HIV today is very different today than it was 20 or 30 years ago. HIV is no longer a death sentence and people living with HIV can live long and healthy lives. </p>
<p>Treatment: There is no cure for HIV, but there are treatments to enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. Treatment for HIV (antiretroviral drugs), works by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.</p>
<p>If you think you have been exposed to HIV, emergency anti-HIV medication called PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) may be provided to reduce your chances of becoming infected, this works best if given within 72 hours of exposure.</p>
<p>If you think you have been exposed to HIV you must go to your nearest sexual health clinic or hospital emergency department (A&amp;E) within 72 hours of exposure.</p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Lymphogranuloma venereum, or LGV, is a curable sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterium from the chlamydia family.</p>
<p>LGV can infect the genitals, anus, rectum, throat or lymph glands in the groin.  In some cases LGV causes a fever, abdominal pain and a feeling of being generally unwell.</p>
<p>Men may notice a discharge of mucus and/or blood from the rectum, pain when they pass a motion or have passive (receptive) anal sex. They may be constipated or have loose motions or a feeling that they have not completely emptied their bowels after passing a motion. Some men notice an open sore or ulcer near the anus or on the penis.</p>
<p>LGV in women is very rare in the UK.  Some people with LGV may not get any symptoms but they can still pass the infection on to their sexual partners.  Prompt treatment is recommended to prevent more serious problems.  If not treated, LGV can cause permanent swelling of the genitals and blockage of the bowel.</p>
<p>LGV used to be very rare in Europe.  Most cases were seen in people who had had sex in tropical regions such as parts of Africa and Asia.  However, in 2004 LGV outbreaks were reported in the Netherlands.  These infections affected men who have sex with men (MSM), especially HIV-positive MSM.  LGV quickly spread to other European countries including the UK.  LGV remains very rare in heterosexual (straight) people in the UK.</p>
<p>LGV is usually treated with an antibiotic called doxycycline which is taken twice a day for three weeks. Sometimes different antibiotics are used.</p>

<p><span>The molluscum<span> contagiosum</span> virus is transmitted through close skin contact, including genital contact during sex.</span></p>
<p>The most common symptom of m<span>olluscum</span><span> contagiosum</span> is the appearance of small spots or abnormal patches on the skin.  This is usually the only symptom.  In sexually active adults, the spots usually appear on the groin area, spreading upwards over the pubic and abdominal (tummy) areas, genitals and inner thighs.</p>
<p>The spots are usually firm, raised and painless.  You may notice that some of the spots have a tiny grey head in the center and look pearly. This head may rupture (split), causing a thick yellowy-white substance to escape.  This substance is highly infectious so you should avoid handling or squeezing the spots, or shaving the skin in that area, as this can spread the infection to other parts of the body.</p>
<p>The spots do not usually leave scars, but you may notice that each one leaves a tiny patch of lighter skin or a small pitted mark.</p>
<p><span>Molluscum</span><span> contagiosum is diagnosed during a physical examination.</span></p>
<p><span>In most cases, <span class="nanospell-typo">molloscum</span> <span class="nanospell-typo">contagiosum</span><span> will go away within 18 months without the need for treatment.

They spread through close body contact, most commonly sexual contact. It is also possible for pubic lice to be spread through sharing clothes, towels and bedding.</p>
<p>After you get pubic lice, it can take several weeks before symptoms appear. The symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Itching in the affected areas</li>
<li>Inflammation or irritation in the affected areas caused by scratching</li>
<li>Black powder in your underwear</li>
<li>Blue-coloured spots on your skin where the lice are living, such as on your thighs or lower abdomen (these are caused by lice bites)</li>
<li>Tiny blood spots on your underwear or skin</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment: You can treat pubic lice yourself at home by using a special type of lotion, cream or shampoo. The treatment is applied to the affected area and sometimes the whole body. It usually needs to be repeated after three to seven days.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist can advise you about which treatment to use and how to use it. It's important to follow this advice.</p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Syphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum and is usually caught by having unprotected sex with someone who is infected. The syphilis-causing bacteria can enter your body if you have close contact with an infected sore, normally during vaginal, anal or oral sex, or by sharing sex toys with someone who is infected. It may also be possible to catch syphilis if you are an injecting drug user and you share a needle with somebody who is infected.</p>
<p>Symptoms - are the same for men and women, and can be difficult to recognise. They are often mild, which means you can pass on the infection without knowing you have it. There are 3 stages of the disease (primary, secondary and tertiary). Syphilis can be passed on at any stage but is most infectious in the primary or secondary stages.</p>
<p>Treatment for syphilis is usually with antibiotic injections.</p>
<p>Pregnant women can pass the condition on to their unborn baby. If untreated, syphilis can cause serious health problems for the mother and her baby, or cause miscarriage or stillbirth. This is why all pregnant women are offered a blood test to check if they have syphilis as part of routine antenatal screening.</p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Thush is a very common condition caused by yeast which lives harmlessly in the female vagina.  Occasionally the yeast overgrows and this overgrowth can cause signs and symptoms.</p>
<p>Though thrush can be passed on during sex, it is not a sexually transmitted infection as such, and it can affect people even when they do not have sex.</p>
<p>Thrush is more common during pregnancy and in people with diabetes, or <span class="nanospell-typo">HIV</span>.  It can also develop when taking certain antibiotics, or chemotherapy treatments that affect the immune system.  Wearing tight clothing can also enable thrush to develop.</p>
<p>Thrush can be made worse by products that may cause irritation of the vagina, such as vaginal deodorant or bubble bath.</p>
<p>Women might notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>itching, soreness and redness around the vulva, vagina and anus</li>
<li>vaginal discharge may become very thick, like cottage cheese</li>
<li>urinating and having sex can be painful</li>
</ul>
<p>Men might notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>irritation, burning or itching under the foreskin or around the tip of the penis</li>
<li>redness of the genital skin or a spotty rash on the head of the penis</li>
<li>a discharge under the foreskin, or swelling</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Thrush is often diagnosed by how it looks, but it can also be tested for by taking swabs from the affected area.</span></p>
<p>Thrush can clear on its own, especially in people who don't have any symptoms.</p>
<p>You can buy anti-fungal cream and <span class="nanospell-typo">pessaries</span> (specially shaped pills which are inserted into the vagina) from a pharmacist, who will advise you on how to use these treatments.  However, if the symptoms do not resolve with these simple measures, you should see your GP or come to a sexual health clinic for a check up.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Trichomonas Vaginalis (TV) is a curable sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a protozoon.  Protozoa are tiny germs similar to bacteria.</p>
<p>TV can infect the vagina, urethra (water passage), and underneath the foreskin.  Women may notice a change in vaginal discharge, and may have vulval itching or pain on passing urine.  Men may notice a discharge from the tip of the penis, pain on passing urine or soreness of the foreskin.  Over 90% of TV cases are diagnosed in women.  If you have TV we recommend that you have tests for other STIs including <a data-id="1325" href="/{localLink:1325}" title="Chlamydia">chlamydia</a>, <a data-id="1326" href="/{localLink:1326}" title="Gonorrhoea">gonorrhoea</a>, <a data-id="1329" href="/{localLink:1329}" title="Syphilis">syphilis</a> and <a data-id="1331" href="/{localLink:1331}" title="HIV">HIV</a>.</p>
<p>You can get TV through unprotected vaginal sex, insertion of fingers into the vagina or sharing sex toys with someone who has TV</p>
<p>Women may not notice anything wrong but they can still pass on TV to their sexual partner. Some women may notice one or more of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>increased vaginal discharge</li>
<li>an unpleasant vaginal smell</li>
<li>‘cystitis’ or burning pain when passing urine</li>
<li>vulval itching or soreness</li>
<li>pain in the vagina during sex</li>
</ul>
<p>Most men will not feel anything wrong but they can still pass TV on to their sexual partner. Some men may notice one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a discharge from the tip of the penis</li>
<li>a burning pain when they pass urine</li>
<li>they want to pass urine more often than normal</li>
<li>soreness around the foreskin</li>
</ul>
<p>TV can be easily treated with antibiotics.</p>

<h2>A woman can get pregnant if a man's sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova).</h2>
<p>Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart, or by stopping egg production, or by stopping the combined sperm and egg (fertilised egg) attaching to the lining of the womb. Contraception is free for most people in the UK. <span class="newWindow"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/what-is-contraception.aspx" target="_blank">With 15 methods to choose from, you can find one that suits you best</a></span>. <span class="newWindow"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/male-condoms.aspx" target="_blank">Barrier methods such as condoms</a></span> are a form of contraception that help to <span class="newWindow"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Sexually-transmitted-infections/Pages/Introduction.aspx" target="_blank">protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</a></span> as well as pregnancy. You should use condoms to protect both your sexual health and that of your partner, no matter what the other contraception you're using to prevent pregnancy. </p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>The contraceptive cap is a circular dome made of thin, soft silicone. It's inserted into the vagina before sex, and covers the cervix so that sperm cannot get into the womb. You need to use spermicide with it (spermicide kills sperm). The cap must be left in place for six hours after sex. After that time, you take out the cap and wash it. Caps are reusable. They come in different sizes, and you must be fitted for the correct size by a trained doctor or nurse.</p>
<p>When used correctly with spermicide, the cap is 92-96% effective at preventing pregnancy. This means that between four and eight women out of every 100 who use a cap as contraception will become pregnant in a year.</p>
<p>The cap does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so using a condom as well will help to protect you against STIs</p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>The combined oral contraceptive pill is usually just called "the pill". It contains artificial versions of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which women produce naturally in their ovaries. The hormones in the pill prevent your ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulating). They also make it difficult for sperm to reach an egg, or for an egg to implant itself in the lining of the womb.</p>
<p>The pill is usually taken to prevent pregnancy, but can also be used to treat painful periods, heavy periods, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and endometriosis.</p>
<p>When taken correctly, the pill is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. This means that fewer than one woman in 100 who use the combined pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year.</p>

<p>The implant stops the release of an egg from the ovary by slowly releasing progestogen into your body. Progestogen also thickens the cervical mucus and thins the womb lining. This makes it harder for sperm to move through your cervix, and less likely for your womb to accept a fertilised egg.</p>
<p>If implanted correctly, it's more than 99% effective. Fewer than one woman in 1,000 who have the implant as contraception for three years will get pregnant.</p>
<p>It can be very useful for women who know they don't want to get pregnant for a while. Once the implant is in place, you don't have to think about contraception for three years. </p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>There are three types of contraceptive injections in the UK: Depo-Provera, which lasts for 12 weeks, Sayana Press, which lasts for 13 weeks, and Noristerat, which lasts for eight weeks. The most popular is Depo-Provera. Noristerat is usually used for only short periods of time – for example, if your partner is waiting for a vasectomy.</p>
<p>The injection contains progestogen. This thickens the mucus in the cervix, stopping sperm reaching an egg. It also thins the womb lining and, in some, prevents the release of an egg.</p>
<p>If used correctly, the contraceptive injection is more than 99% effective. This means that less than one woman in 100 who use the injection will become pregnant in a year.</p>
<p>The injection lasts for eight, 12 or 13 weeks (depending on the type), so you don't have to think about contraception every day or every time you have sex.</p>
<p>It can be useful for women who might forget to take the contraceptive pill every day or who can't use contraception that contains oestrogen. It can take up to one year for your fertility to return to normal after the injection wears off, so it may not be suitable if you want to have a baby in the near future.</p>
<p>The injection does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the injection, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs.</p>

<p>Each patch lasts for one week. You change the patch every week for three weeks, then have a week off without a patch. You don't need to think about it every day, and it's still effective if you vomit or have diarrhoea.</p>

<p>An IUD works as soon as it's put in, and lasts for five to 10 years, depending on the type.</p>
<p>It can be put in at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you're not pregnant and can be removed at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and you'll quickly return to normal levels of fertility.</p>

<p>The IUS is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. It works for five years or three years, depending on the type, so you don't have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Two brands of IUS are used in the UK – Mirena and Jaydess. </p>
<p>You can use an IUS whether or not you've had children.</p>
<p>It's more than 99% effective. Less than one in every 100 women who use Mirena will get pregnant in five years, and less than one in 100 who use Jaydess will get pregnant in three years. It can be taken out at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and your fertility quickly returns to normal.</p>
<p>The IUS does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUS, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs.</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)?</span></h3>
<p>PEP is a combination of HIV medications that may significantly reduce your risk of being infected with HIV. You must start taking PEP within 72 hours of an activity with a high risk of HIV exposure although the sooner you start taking PEP the better chance it has to work.</p>
<p>I think I need PEP, what do I do?</p>
<p>If you think you might have been exposed to HIV then you must start the medication as soon as possible after the episode of risk. The sooner PEP is started, the more likely it is to work; within 24 hours is best, but no later than 72 hours. After 72 hours PEP is unlikely to work and will not be provided.<br /> You must take the medication as directed for 28 days. PEP interferes with the HIV’s ability to copy itself in your body after you’ve been exposed. This prevents it from establishing an infection.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Truvada tablet to be taken at the SAME TIME every day</li>
<li>1 raltegravir tablet taken at the SAME TIME every morning and evening 12 hours apart E.g. 8am and 8pm</li>
</ul>
<p><a data-id="1441" href="/media/1064/pepse-v2.pdf" title="PEPSE v2.pdf">PEP poster</a></p>
<p>PEP is available from <a data-id="1119" href="/{localLink:1119}" title="Local Services">sexual health clinics</a> during opening hours.</p>
<p>If the clinic is closed DON'T DELAY, go to your nearest hospital A&amp;E department for an assessment as the sooner you start to take the medication, the better chance you have of preventing HIV.</p>
<p>If you attend A&amp;E they might only provide you with a starter pack (3-5 days worth of medication). It is important that you attend a sexual health clinic for the remaining month’s supply of medication.</p>
<p>Your GP cannot prescribe PEP. <span class="newWindow"><a href="http://www.bashh.org/documents/PEPSE%202015%20guideline%20final_NICE.pdf" target="_blank">See the prescribing recommendations here</a></span>: (Table 3 from page 18)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)?</span></h3>
<p>PrEP is the use of anti-HIV medication (Truvada) to keep HIV negative people from becoming infected with HIV.</p>
<p>A number of studies have shown that PrEP is safe and effective. The <a href="http://i-base.info/htb/29040" target="_blank" title="PROUD study">PROUD study</a> in the UK looked at whether offering daily PrEP to men who have sex with men was an effective way to prevent HIV infection. The results show that PrEP is highly protective, reducing the risk of infection for this group by 86%.</p>
<p>Currently PrEP is not available on the NHS in the UK – click<a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2016/12/hiv-prevention-pregramme/" target="_blank"> here </a> to see a recent announcement from NHS England.</p>
<p>Some people are tempted to buy PrEP on-line. If you are tempted to buy PrEP yourself we advise reading the <a href="http://i-base.info/uk-guide-to-prep/">UK guide to PReP (Nov 16)</a> for further information and advice.</p>
<p>If you have chosen to take PrEP that you have bought on-line we would recommend that you attend the LGBT+ clinic (Mondays 4-6.30pm) at the <a data-id="1322" href="/{localLink:1322}" title="Florey Clinic">Florey Clinic</a> or contact the Health Advising Team at the <a data-id="1323" href="/{localLink:1323}" title="Garden Clinic">Garden Clinic</a> on 01753 635330 so that additional advice, information and support can be provided.</p>

<h2>What does the chlamydia test involve?</h2>
<p>The recommended tests for chlamydia are simple, painless and generally very reliable.</p>
<p>They involve sending a sample of cells to a laboratory for analysis. You don't necessarily have to be examined by a doctor or nurse first and can often collect the sample yourself.</p>
<p>There are two main ways the sample can be collected:</p>
<ul>
<li>using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina or inside the anus</li>
<li>urinating into a container – this should ideally be done after at least one or two hours since you last urinated</li>
</ul>
<p>Men will usually be asked to provide a urine sample, while women will usually be asked to either swab inside their vagina or provide a urine sample.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>If you think you could be pregnant you should do a pregnancy test as soon as possible. You can buy a pregnancy testing kit from any pharmacy e.g. Clearblue. You can do a pregnancy test from the first day of a missed period. It’s best to test the first urine sample in the morning as this will be more concentrated. If you do the test too early in pregnancy it may not show up and will give you an incorrect result.</p>
<p>If you don’t know when your next period is due you can do a test 3 weeks after unprotected sex.</p>
<h2>Free pregnancy testing is available from the following services:</h2>

<h2>I am pregnant - what next?</h2>
<p>If the pregnancy test is positive this means you are pregnant. Most self-test kits are reliable.<br /> Whatever you feel you need to make a decision about what you want to do. The decision is yours; never feel pressurised by others to do something you don’t want to do.</p>
<p>There are three options for you to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue with the pregnancy</li>
<li>end the pregnancy by having an abortion</li>
<li>continue with the pregnancy and have the baby adopted or fostered</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important not to delay making your decision. Abortion is safer and easier the earlier it is done in pregnancy and needs in most circumstances to be done before 13 weeks gestation (13 weeks from first day of last period). It is important to get advice as soon as possible, because it can take a month to organise things.</p>
<p>The following services can help you make your decision by providing confidential advice and information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your GP or practice nurse</li>
<li>Your local sexual health clinic</li>
<li>Your local young persons clinic - click here to find your nearest SpeakEasy or HealthZone</li>
<li>Your local termination of pregnancy (abortion) provider (BPAS)</li>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Sexuality is quite a big term so it’s easier to understand if it is broken down.</p>
<h2>Sexual orientation</h2>
<p><strong>Sexual orientation</strong> is a person’s attraction to the same, opposite or both sexes</p>
<p>This is where labels are often used to group people together – lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans* etc</p>
<h2>Sexual identity</h2>
<p><strong>Sexual identity</strong> is how people see themselves</p>
<p>This is where an individual sees themselves as male or female.  Sometimes this is the same as the physical gender they have at birth, sometimes it is not. If not then these people are often referred to as trans* and may wish to (or not) have surgery to change their physical gender appearance.</p>
<h2>Sexual behaviour</h2>
<p><strong>Sexual behaviour</strong> is what a person does sexually, (this does not always match a person’s sexual identity or orientation).</p>
<p>This is the sexual act itself, it can take place on your own or between 2 or more people. It is always important to be happy with what you and doing and what other people are doing to you. Consent is really important and boundaries should be discussed before you start having sex to prevent being pressured into doing something you are not happy with.</p>
<p><strong>These three aspects make up your sexuality</strong></p>
<p>Sexuality is part of your personality, it’s how you feel about yourself as a sexual being and how others see you. Your emotions, feelings, behaviour and culture all help to define your sexuality. It can also change over time as you experience different life events.</p>
<p>Some religions and cultures say that sex should only be between a man and a woman in order to have children. It can therefore be very difficult as a person from one of these groups if you feel that you ‘don’t fit in to the norm’ as getting appropriate advice and support can be a struggle. </p>
<p>It is important to know that you are not alone, there are many organisations and <a href="/local-services/useful-contacts/">support groups</a> out there to help you.</p>
<p>However a person thinks of themselves whether that is gay, straight, lesbian, bi, trans* etc. they deserve to be treated with respect.</p>
<p>Like your body and your brain, your sexuality develops throughout your life. It may take time to figure out who you are and what you want, but that’s all part of the process. Take your time.</p>

<p>If you identify as LGBT* you are welcome to attend any of our clinics at any time. A specific LGBT* service is provided at the <a data-id="1322" href="/{localLink:1322}" title="Florey Clinic">Florey clinic</a> every Monday 4-6.30pm. A specific MSM service is provided at the <a data-id="1322" href="/{localLink:1322}" title="Florey Clinic">Florey clinic</a> every Wednesday 8-10am.</p>
<p>Trans* is a term that refers to all of the identities within the gender identity spectrum. The asterisk makes an effort to include all transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming identities, including (but not limited to) transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, genderless, agender, non-gendered, third gender, two-spirit, bigender, and trans man and trans woman.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h2>What is consent?</h2>
<p>Someone consents to sexual activity or contact only if they…</p>
<p>‘Agree by choice and have the freedom and capacity to make that choice.’ (Sexual Offences Act 2003).</p>
<h2>What do we mean by freedom and capacity?</h2>
<p>Someone might not have the freedom to consent if…</p>
<ul>
<li>There was an abuse of power or trust</li>
<li>One person was dependent on another</li>
<li>One person uses force or power during sexual activity or contact</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone won’t have capacity to consent if…</p>
<ul>
<li>They are under the influence of alcohol or drugs</li>
<li>They are asleep or unconscious. You can’t assume that someone wants to carry on if they fall asleep or pass out.</li>
<li>They have a medical condition, mental health problem or learning disability</li>
<li>They aren’t old enough to consent</li>
</ul>
<p>The law says it's legal for you to agree – or consent – to sex from the age of 16. There is however, much more to consent than just being of the legal age. Whether it is with an acquaintance, a friend, an ex or with a boyfriend or girlfriend, it is your right to say no to any form of sexual activity or contact at any age and at any time. This is the same no matter your gender or sexual orientation. This forms an essential part of a healthy relationship.</p>
<h2>What do you need to know about consent?</h2>
<ul>
<li>No automatic invites. This covers a number of issues relating to consent. Consenting to one form of sexual activity or contact doesn’t mean someone consents to all activity. If a person is dressed in a certain way or is flirting, this is not an automatic invite. Similarly even if consent has been given for sexual activity in the past does not mean consent will automatically be given again</li>
<li>No verbal consent. Someone doesn’t actually have to say the word ‘no’ to show a lack of consent. Body language that can imply ‘no’ can include being tense, frightened or nervous or not wanting to be touched, kissed or hugged</li>
<li>No pressure. Consent has not been freely given if someone feels pressured into it. Being pestered, intimated, or threatened (physically or emotionally) or being called ‘frigid’, made to feel stupid/bad or encouraged to drink alcohol or take drugs are all forms of pressure</li>
<li>No commitment. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. Yes, even mid activity!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Communication is key</h2>
<p>You can never assume that someone is giving consent. The easiest way to make sure consent is given is simply to ask someone before sexual activity or contact occurs. If the person freely responds with ‘yes’ (without force or pressure) then this is consent.</p>
<p>Remember, it’s your body and only you can decide what you do with it!</p>
<p>If you think you have had sexual activity without giving consent - see our pages on sexual assault and rape for information and advice.</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Child sexual exploitation (CSE) is the term used for contact or non-contact sexual abuse of a child, when there is any actual or attempted abuse of a child’s vulnerability or trust and an opportunity for the abuser to enhance their social standing or receive payment from third parties. Non-contact abuse includes online grooming and sexual exploitation. Children and young people under the age of 18 can be victims of child sexual exploitation.</p>
<p>CSE can take many forms but most commonly happens in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual exploitation of children and young people under 18 involves exploitative situations, contexts and relationships where young people (or a third person or persons) receive ‘something’ (e.g. food, accommodation, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, affection, gifts, money) as a result of them performing, and/or another or others performing on them, sexual activities.</li>
<li>Child sexual exploitation can occur through the use of technology without the child’s immediate recognition; for example being persuaded to post sexual images on the Internet/mobile phones without immediate payment or gain. In all cases, those exploiting the child/young person have power over them by virtue of their age, gender, intellect, physical strength and/or economic or other resources.</li>
<li>Violence, coercion and intimidation are common, involvement in exploitative relationships being characterised in the main by the child or young person’s limited availability of choice resulting from their social/economic and/or emotional vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think this might be happening to you or to a child or young person you know, you should report your <span class="newWindow"><a href="http://www.proceduresonline.com/berks/" target="_blank">concerns to your local children's safeguarding team</a></span>.</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h2>Young People</h2>
<p>The law is there to protect young people. Laws exist to help young people make decisions which are right and that they are happy with. No young person should be pressured, bullied or encouraged to do anything they do not feel comfortable with or which they know is wrong.</p>
<p>The age of consent to any form of sexual activity is 16 for both men and women. The age of consent is the same regardless of gender or sexual orientation. It is an offence for anyone to have sexual activity with a person under the age of 16.</p>
<p>A child under 13 years old cannot give consent to any form of sexual activity.</p>
<p>However, the Home Office recommends that teenagers under the age of 16 will not be prosecuted where they both mutually agree and where the young people concerned are of a similar age.</p>
<p>It is an offence for a person aged 18 or over to have sexual activity with a person under the age of 18 if the older person holds a position of trust, eg. school teacher or social worker.</p>
<p>As regards sexting, this is an increasingly common activity among young people where inappropriate or explicit images are shared on line or through mobile phones. It is a criminal offence to take, possess or share indecent images of anyone under 18 even if you are the person in the picture.</p>
<h2>HIV and the law</h2>
<p>You may have heard or read about prosecutions for HIV transmission that have taken place in England, Scotland and Wales. Some people have been found guilty and sent to prison.</p>
<p>The law differs slightly in Scotland to that in England and Wales, however you can be prosecuted in all three countries. For example, in England and Wales you can only be prosecuted if you have actually passed on HIV. In Scotland, you can also be prosecuted for putting someone at risk through unprotected sex.</p>
<p><span class="newWindow"><a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/myhiv/Telling-people/Law/How-the-law-works" target="_blank">Read more about HIV and the law here</a></span></p>
<p>Prosecutions have happened, not just for HIV but also for sexual transmission of other infections - for example hepatitis B and hepatitis C. HIV is still the subject of nearly all investigations and prosecutions. However, much of the advice applies equally to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).<br /> The information here is not a substitute for expert legal advice. If you are involved in a prosecution, particularly if you are being prosecuted, it’s extremely important to get expert legal advice, the <span class="newWindow"><a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/" target="_blank">Terence Higgins Trust can provide a referral</a></span>.</p>
<p>Using a condom and making sure that your partner knows you have HIV, and that whatever sex you have is consensual within this knowledge is the best way to avoid prosecution. If you don’t feel able to tell partners about your diagnosis, you should use a condom when having sex to avoid passing HIV on.</p>
<p>If you find it difficult to use a condom, or difficult to insist that your sexual partner uses a condom, help and advice are available from your HIV clinic or local HIV support organisation</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Commercial sex is the engagement in sexual activity in exchange for money, goods, or other negotiated items. The key thing is that someone is engaging in sexual activity for some kind of imbursement.</p>
<p>All types of people work in the sex industry. Sometimes this is in the short term (to fund University or pay off a debt), for others, sex work is something they choose to do long term.</p>
<h2>Legal aspects</h2>
<p>The UK legal system surrounding sex work can be very confusing. In brief, working alone indoors is legal. ‘Pimping’ or running an agency or brothel is illegal (a brothel is anywhere that more than one person has sex outside of marriage) but it is legal to work as a sex worker in a brothel as long as you are not involved in the running of the premises. On-street work or soliciting is illegal.</p>
<p>Sex workers can be male, female or trans* and may come from a variety of backgrounds. Sometimes sex workers adopt a different persona for the work they undertake, this persona may be very different to their personal life e.g. a ‘straight’ man may engage in ‘gay’ sex for work.</p>
<h2>Keeping Safe</h2>
<p>If you are working in the sex industry there are risk factors that need to be considered in order to keep yourself safe industry. This applies however you choose to work, (in a brothel, on the street, independently, in a club).</p>
<p>It is important to trust your instincts but, if you get high, drunk or stoned when working, your judgement will be impaired. Practicing safer sex with clients will protect you from STIs, blood borne viruses such as HIV and unwanted pregnancy. Even if your client is willing to pay more for having sex without condoms you must consider the increased risks you are putting yourself at.</p>
<h2>Sex worker support</h2>
<p>If you are working in the sex industry it is important to have regular sexual health check-ups. You can also receive vaccinations for <a data-id="1445" href="/{localLink:1445}" title="Hepatitis">Hepatitis B</a> (an infection of your liver). These services are provided for<a data-id="1119" href="/{localLink:1119}" title="Local Services"> free at your local sexual health clinic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rahab (Restoring all Hope and Belief), </strong> is a local organisation who provide help advocacy or support for anyone involved in on- or off-street prostitution, the commercial sex industry and victims of human trafficking. Rahab provide both day and night outreach and their volunteers provide vital items (food &amp; drink, contraception, rape alarms) and support to the men and women working on-street.</p>

<p><strong>SWISH</strong> (Sex Workers into Sexual Health) is a London based charity that knows the sex industry - they haven’t seen it all, but they’ve seen a lot. They provide confidential services and their trained support workers can meet you on a one-to-one basis.</p>

<p><strong>National Ugly Mugs (NUM)</strong> is a scheme developed by The UK Network for Sex Work Projects (UKNSWP), which aims to keep sex workers safer from abuse at work by sharing accounts or ‘alerts’ of dodgy punters. NUM alerts can be reported confidentially (you can use a fake name to protect your identity) and reporting does not mean that you have to provide evidence or deal with the police if you don’t want to. The scheme is about alerting other sex workers and sharing information to keep everyone safer and to hopefully help deter bad punters. They also have a magazine to update you about incidents if you’re not online.</p>

<h2>Sexual Exploitation</h2>
<p>Sexual exploitation is when someone is providing sex work when they have been manipulated or coerced into sexual activities of any kind for another person’s gain. This can include human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation or grooming involving sexual ‘favours’.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know or may suspect could be involved or victim to the description above help and support is available for various subsequent needs, including Mental Health, Immigration Support and other practical types of Support.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h2>What is sexting?</h2>
<p>Sexting is becoming increasingly common. It is the sharing of sexually explicit or inappropriate images, videos or messages either online or via mobile phones. It can be shared between partners, friends and strangers.</p>
<h2>Before you send content, think about…</h2>
<h3>The law</h3>
<p>First of all, even if a picture or video is taken and sent with a person’s permission, sexting by people under 18 is illegal. This is because it is essentially creating, sharing and keeping indecent content of a child. This law is, first and foremost, there to protect young people.</p>
<h3>What could happen to it</h3>
<p>The second that inappropriate images, videos or messages leave your phone or are shared online, where they go can not be controlled. They can be saved or copied by others and there is the risk that they can become public.</p>
<h3>The long term risk</h3>
<p>Sharing content is a long term risk even if they are sent via ‘private’ apps that imply that images and videos ‘self destruct’ after a certain amount of time. Explicit content is easy to save and although you may trust the person you send it to now not to share it further, this may change in future. It could end up in the wrong hands.</p>
<h3>Why you want to send it</h3>
<p>There are a number of reasons why sexting can happen. You may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be in love with the person and trust them completely and feel like it’s ok</li>
<li>Have a long distance or online relationship with someone and want to have a sexual relationship with them</li>
<li>Feel proud of your body and want to share it with other people</li>
<li>Feel like 'everyone else is doing it' and want to fit in with in with friends - especially if they are boasting about sending or having photos on their mobile phone</li>

<p>Sexting can have the opposite effect that many people want it to. What can be seen as impressing someone now may have consequences in future. Don’t ever think that just because someone is pressuring you into sending them explicit content that you have to do so.</p>
<h3>How you might feel if it is shared.</h3>
<p>The distribution of sexually explicit content can be both distressing and upsetting for those involved, especially if it is shared by someone they trusted. Think about your reputation both now and in the future.</p>
<h2>What if it’s already been sent?</h2>
<p>Talk to the person that you sent it to and ask them to delete contents from anywhere that it is saved. This includes on technology and external storages devices (such as iCloud).</p>
<p>If you are worried about content being shared then you can contact ChildLine confidentially by calling 0800 11 11.</p>
<p>If content has been shared then talk to an adult close to you (family member or teacher). By letting them know what has happened they will be able to support you to take control of the situation. In some cases it may be necessary to contact your local police so that they can help to prevent content being shared. It is not OK for them to share your image without your permission and, as explained above, the law is there to protect you.</p>
<p>If you are concerned that you have been groomed or pressured into sending content to someone over 18 then it’s important that you <span class="newWindow"><a href="https://www.ceop.police.uk/Ceop-Report/" target="_blank">make a report to the National Crime Agency’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre</a></span>. Their aim is to make sure that you stay safe online and don’t do anything that you don’t feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>If you are a parent and you are concerned about sexting then you can find <span class="newWindow"><a href="https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/keeping-children-safe/sexting/" target="_blank">information and advice on the NSPCC website</a></span>.</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h2>Sexual Assault and Rape</h2>
<p>If you have been raped or sexually assaulted sexual health services are often one of the first places people think of coming to for help, both men and women can be sexually assaulted or raped.<br />It is important to remind yourself that you are not to blame. Nothing that you have done can make a person rape or sexually assault you. You are not responsible for someone else’s actions. There is no right or wrong way to respond in situations of sexual attack. Common feelings after rape or sexual assault include self-blame, guilt, fear, anxiety, shame and anger.</p>
<p>Following an assault there are some options for you to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to report it to the police it is a good idea to do that as soon as possible. You can contact Thames Valley Police on 101 (or 999 in an emergency).</li>
<li>If you are not sure about reporting it to the police you can attend a Sexual Assault Referral Centre.</li>
<li><a data-id="1119" href="/{localLink:1119}" title="Local Services">You can also come to one of the sexual health clinics </a>where we can provide a full range of support, advice, screening, vaccinations, PEPSE, and emergency contraception.</li>
<li>We can also supply information about other agencies that you might like to consider contacting for ongoing support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is a Sexual Assault Referral Centre?</h3>
<p>Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) offer a safe, discreet and caring environment to support victims of rape and sexual assault and their families. You will have access to a trained crisis worker who will be with you throughout your time in the SARC.</p>
<h3>A SARC can provide</h3>
<ul>
<li>a forensic examination by a specialist forensic doctor who will treat you with dignity and respect and will always ask for your consent before examining you.</li>
<li>crisis support at your initial visit and arrange follow up appointments<br />telephone advice</li>
<li>independent advocacy and support with practical matters</li>
<li>Introduction to other support services, for example Rape Crisis and Victim Support</li>
</ul>

An ISVA is there to provide you with information only, and you are not expected to report any offence to the police unless you wish to do so.</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the partial or total removal of external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. It's also known as female circumcision, cutting or sunna.</p>
<p>Religious, social or cultural reasons are sometimes given for FGM. However, FGM is child abuse. It's dangerous and a criminal offence.</p>
<p>There are no medical reasons to carry out FGM. It doesn't enhance fertility and it doesn't make childbirth safer. It is used to control female sexuality and can cause severe and long-lasting damage to physical and emotional health.</p>
<p>FGM has been a criminal offence in the UK since 1985. In 2003 it also became a criminal offence for UK nationals or permanent UK residents to take their child abroad to have female genital mutilation. Anyone found guilty of the offence faces a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.</p>
<p>From July 2015 anyone can apply to the court for an FGM Protection Order if they are concerned that someone is at risk of FGM. Breaching an FGM Protection Order is a criminal offence with a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment.</p>
<p>From October 2015, the FGM Act 2003 (as amended by section 74 of the Serious Crime Act 2015) introduced a mandatory reporting duty for all regulated health and social care professionals and teachers in England and Wales. Professionals must make a report to the police, if, in the course of their duties:<br /> they are informed by a girl under the age of 18 that she has undergone an act of FGM<br /> or<br /> they observe physical signs that an act of FGM may have been carried out on a girl under the age of 18.</p>
<h2>How FGM happens</h2>
<p>The term FGM covers all harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes. There are four types - all are illegal and have serious health risks.<br /> FGM ranges from pricking or cauterizing the genital area, through partial or total removal of the clitoris, cutting the lips (the labia) and narrowing the vaginal opening.</p>
<h2>How common is FGM?</h2>
<p><span class="newWindow"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/female-genital-mutilation/Pages/Introduction.aspx" target="_blank">Information regarding FGM on NHS Choices</a></span></p>
<p>FGM is a hidden crime, so we don't know exactly how common it is. Even partial removal or 'nipping' can risk serious health problems for girls and women.<br /> FGM is usually performed by someone with no medical training. Girls are given no anesthetic, no antiseptic treatment and are often forcibly restrained. The cutting is made using instruments such as a knife, pair of scissors, scalpel, glass or razor blade.</p>
<h2>Where can I get support?</h2>
<ul>
<li>FGM is a crime and as such anyone who believes that it is currently taking place or that a child is in immediate risk should contact the police on 999.</li>
<li>The Met police have a dedicated service for girls at risk of FGM, Project Azure 0207 1612888. </li>
<li>The NSPCC are a national lead for FGM and have a specific FGM helpline 08080 283550. You can <span class="newWindow"><a href="https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/female-genital-mutilation-fgm" target="_blank">read more on the NSPCC website</a></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Daughters of  Eve is a non profit organisation, that works to advance and protect the physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health rights of  young people from female genital mutilation practising communities.  </p>
<p>You can contact them on 07983030488</p>]]></bodyText>

<li>Record important clinical information</li>
<li>Help health professionals care for you, and Improve public health and the services provided to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will only share information about you with your consent unless we are worried about your immediate safety or if required to do so by law.</p>
<p><span class="h3"><strong>Under 16</strong></span></p>
<p>Sexual health services (contraception and pregnancy advice, or tests for STIs, including HIV) are free and confidential.</p>
<p>If you're 13 to 16, you have the same rights to confidentiality as an adult and the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents, or anyone else, as long as they believe that you fully understand the information and decisions involved.</p>
<p>They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents or carers, but they won't make you.</p>
<p>Even if the doctor, nurse or pharmacist feels that you're not mature enough to make a decision yourself, the consultation will still be confidential. They won't tell anyone that you saw them, or anything about what you said.</p>
<p>The only time a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe there is a risk to your safety or welfare, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.</p>
<p>The situation is different for people under 13, because the law says that people of this age can't consent (say yes) to sexual activity. If you're under 13, doctors, nurses and health workers might feel it's in your best interests to involve other people, such as a social worker.</p>]]></bodyText>
